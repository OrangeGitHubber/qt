# What we've done — plain-English changelog

Newest first. Each phase links to the technical details in
[how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md) and the reasoning in [decisions.md](decisions.md).

## Watchlist stats & price history (2026-07-17)

The watchlist now answers "is this symbol worth trading, and can my settings
even survive it?" at a glance:

- **30 day** — medium-term momentum, closer to a swing strategy's horizon
  than today's noise.
- **Daily move ([ATR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp))** — how
  much this symbol typically moves in a day, gaps included. The most
  decision-relevant number on the page: a trailing stop tighter than ATR will
  shake you out of good trades for no reason.
- **vs 200-day average** — the same trend test the regime filter applies to
  the S&P 500, per symbol.

Columns are toggleable, each explained by a tooltip. They're computed from
daily bars fetched **once per day** and cached, and if that history fetch
fails the prices still show — only the extra columns go quiet.

**Click any ticker** for its full price history (as far back as the data plan
allows — roughly 2016 for stocks) with 1M/6M/1Y/5Y/Max ranges. **Hover the
line** and the price, date, and change-from-start track your cursor.

## Symbol search, honest backtest metrics (2026-07-16)

**Type a company name, not a ticker.** Every place you used to type raw
symbols — watchlist, backtest, the scanner's exclude list — now autocompletes
on **ticker or company name** ("nvidia" finds NVDA). It's backed by a local
copy of Alpaca's ~11,000 tradable symbols, refreshed daily, so search is
instant, costs no API calls, and works even if Alpaca is unreachable. Adding
a known symbol no longer needs a live quote check either. Sync status and a
manual "Sync now" button live in Settings.

**The backtest stops flattering itself.** Two additions after a real result
was easy to misread:

- **Buy-and-hold benchmark of the symbols you actually tested**, not just
  SPY. If you backtest NVDA, the honest question is "would I have done better
  just holding NVDA?" — now the chart answers it, with the broad market shown
  as a secondary line.
- **Capital deployment**: how much of your account was ever really invested,
  how long it held anything, and the return on the money actually used. A
  strategy risking $200 of a $5,000 account can post a great trade record and
  a ~1% account return — those are different facts, and the UI now says so
  instead of letting them blur.

## Phase 2.5 — Minimal backtester (2026-07-13)

A new **Backtest** tab replays any saved strategy over up to two years of
historical prices — using the *same* decision code the live engine runs, so
the test can't lie about what the bot would do. You get net P&L after
[spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp) costs, win rate,
[profit factor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit_factor.asp),
[max drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp),
an equity curve charted against buy-and-hold SPY/BTC, and every simulated
trade with its reason. Honest limits are stated in the UI: it replays a fixed
symbol list (not the scanner's historical daily picks), and past performance
predicts nothing — a backtest exists to kill bad ideas cheaply.

## Phase 2 (in progress — July 2026)

The trading engine. Google Sign-In in front of everything, database
migrations, strategies you configure from presets, a
[regime filter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) that
keeps the bot out of falling markets, a benchmark scoreboard that honestly
compares the bot against "just buy and hold", a zero-risk **shadow mode**
that journals every trade the bot *would* make without placing orders, and
finally simulated ([paper](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp))
order execution with strict risk rails.

## Phase 1 — Market scanner & watchlist (2026-07-13)

The app can now *see* the market:

- **Scanner**: finds today's biggest risers among US stocks (via Alpaca's
  movers screener) and crypto (computed from snapshots of every tradable
  USD pair). You control the filters visually: minimum price, minimum
  [dollar volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) (so the
  bot avoids illiquid symbols that are hard to sell), minimum % gain, and
  an exclude list.
- **Watchlist**: pin symbols you always want considered, with live prices
  and mini trend charts.
- Results are cached briefly so the UI can never exceed Alpaca's
  [API rate limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting).

## Phase 0 — Walking skeleton (2026-07-13)

The foundation:

- Web app (Python/[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) backend,
  [React](https://react.dev/) frontend) in a single Docker container for unraid.
- Setup wizard that verifies your [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets)
  [paper-trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp) keys
  and stores them [encrypted at rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest#Encryption).
- Status dashboard: account equity/cash, market open/closed, and a permanent
  "PAPER MODE" banner.
- GitHub Actions build the Docker image automatically on every push.
